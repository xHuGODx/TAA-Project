# Research Problem

## Problem statement

Income inequality is one of the most worrying social and economic challenges in modern society. Predicting whether an individual earns more than $50K/year based on demographic and employment attributes will provide valuable insights into factors that influence economic success. This problem involves building a classification model that accurately predicts income levels using data from the **Adult Census Dataset**. This dataset includes attributes such as *age*, *education*, *marital status*, *occupation*, and *hours worked per week*.

The challenge is to identify patterns and relationships within this data to distinguish people earning above or below the $50K threshold. The complexity of this problem is introduced due to the influence of many factors, including socio economic variables, and the presence of noise or bias in the data. By solving this problem, we can better understand trends in society and inequality, as well as improve decision making processes in various fields.

## Importance of predicting income

Predicting income levels has significant implications for both social and economic analysis:

### Policy Making
Policymakers can use insights from income predictions to design more targeted interventions aimed at reducing income inequality. For instance, understanding how education or housing factors contribute to higher income levels can inform decisions about funding educational programs, for example helping women in rural areas, which are often at a disadvantage in terms of opportunities compared to their urban counterparts, get access to better education.

### Workforce Planning
Employers and workforce planners can leverage income predictions to identify skills or qualifications associated with higher income levels. This can guide training programs and help organizations invest in an employee's career development, training them in qualifications that would require a high income employee, reducing the need to hire externally and saving money. For individuals, this can help them make informed decisions about their career paths and educational investments.

### Economics
Income predictios can contribute to other models that forecast consumption, savings, and investment trends. Additionally, financial institutions can use income predictions for credit risk analysis. By understanding an individual's potential income level, they can more accurately predict their ability to repay loans, which can help in determining interest rates and loan amounts.

### Social Research
Researchers studying income inequality and social mobility can use these models to analyze the factors that influence income inequality. This can uncover systemic biases that need to be addressed to move twoards a more equitable society.

## Real world use cases
### Government and Public Policy
Governments can use income prediction models to evaluate the impact of tax policies, welfare programs, and economic reforms on different population groups. By analyzing predicted income trends, policymakers can create more equitable policies.
#### Example
A government uses income prediction models to analyze how a proposed increase in tax rates for high income earners affects income distribution. The model predicts that a 2% tax increase for individuals earning above $100K would generate additional revenue to fund education programs for low income families, without significantly impacting the spending habits of high earners.

### Education and Career Counseling
Career counselors can use income prediction models to guide students toward career paths and educational programs that maximize their earning potential, while also considering their demographic and personal circumstances.
#### Example
An university uses predictive models to advise students on the earning potential of different career paths. For example, the model might show that graduates with data science skills in the technology area have an average starting salary of $80K, while those pursuing careers in arts and humanities have a starting salary of $40K. Based on this, counselors can recommend certain majors or minors to students, helping them make informed decisions about their education.


### Hiring and Recruitment
Companies can use income prediction models to benchmark salaries, ensuring they remain competitive in the job market, and to identify high potential candidates for leadership or specialized roles.
#### Example
A multinational company uses an income prediction model to compare salaries across industries and regions. They discover that data engineers in Alaska earn an average of $150K, while the same role in Ohio pays $120K. This insight helps the company offer regionally adapted salaries to attract employees while also ensuring they are not overpaying for similar roles in different locations.


### Marketing and Consumer Targeting
Businesses can use income prediction models to better understand their target audience, classify customers, and customize marketing based on predicted income levels.
#### Example
A fast food chain uses income predictions to identify areas with lower income populations and launches a campaign for their budget friendly meal deals. For example, they focus on urban neighborhoods with average incomes below $40K, leading to increase in sales at locations in those areas.

### Non Profit and Social Organizations
Non profit organizations working on poverty issues can use income prediction models to identify at risk populations and allocate more resources to areas with the greatest need.

I'm working with the Adult Census dataset (adultdataset.csv) and I've cleaned it by removing dots and replacing ? values with NaN. I’ve loaded the data using pandas.read_csv(), and I’m analyzing the dataset by taking into account the fnlwgt column (final weight), which represents how many people each row statistically stands for.

The total sum of fnlwgt in my dataset is 9,263,575,662.

I'm scaling the dataset to match the realistic 1995 U.S. population of 269.7 million, so I'm using this scaling factor:
scaling_factor = 269_700_000 / 9_263_575_662

I want to:

Generate detailed statistical summaries (means, distributions, etc.) for both unweighted and weighted data.

Use the fnlwgt_scaled column to reflect the true population proportions in all my analysis.

Save all textual analysis to info.txt.

Create graphs (bar plots, histograms, etc.) using both unweighted and fnlwgt_scaled data.

Keep the analysis clean, readable, and grouped by relevant topics (e.g., age distribution, income breakdown, education levels, etc.).

Please help me continue with the analysis, graph generation, or anything else you think is useful for exploring this dataset correctly with population weighting.
